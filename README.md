## 💡 Overview

Traditional corporate performance systems suffer from visibility gaps, misaligned KPIs, and slow appraisal cycles. **Nexus Pulse** eliminates all of that — a serverless, cost-optimized platform unifying goal setting, progress tracking, and compliance management across Employees, Managers, and Admins in one seamless loop.

## 👥 Demo Roles

Access all roles directly from the root Identity Gate — no login required.

| Role | UUID | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | `00000000-...-0001` | Build goals, submit quarterly check-ins |
| L1 Manager | `b26ab711-...-0000` | Inline edits, approvals, system lock |
| HR Admin | `c37bc832-...-0000` | Audit logs, analytics, CSV export |

## ✨ Features & Evaluation Checkpoints

### 🎯 Phase 1 — Goal Architecture
- **Smart Guardrails** — Backend blocks any sheet where total weightage ≠ `100%` or any goal drops below `10%`. Max `8` goals per employee.
- **Manager Override Console** — L1 Managers edit targets/weightage inline before authorizing.
- **Post-Auth Locks** — Once approved, employee parameters become immutable mid-cycle.
- **Shared KPI Broadcast** — Executives push goals org-wide; child clones lock Title & Target, only weightage is editable.

### 📊 Phase 2 — Telemetry & Scoring Engine
- **Quarterly Isolation** — Strict Q1–Q4 reporting windows.
- **Dynamic Score Formulas by UoM type:**
  - *Higher is Better →* `(Actual ÷ Target) × 100`
  - *Lower is Better →* `(Target ÷ Actual) × 100`
  - *Timeline / Zero-Incident →* Binary boundary evaluation

### 🔐 Bonus Modules
- **Immutable Audit Trail** — Every post-lock change logs actor identity, delta, and timestamp to `audit_logs`.
- **Escalation Engine** — Stalled approvals auto-escalate: Employee → Manager → HR via rule-based tier sweeps.
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Thrust area distributions, task completion rates, and active alert monitoring.
- **CSV Exporter** — One-click streaming of full performance data from Postgres to `.csv`.
